### Training simple neural networks on the MNIST dataset using keras

For the National Meeting of Data-Intensive Science CDTs in Edinburgh.

`MNIS_Edinburgh.ipynb` - train fully-connected and convolutional networks on 10% of the MNIST dataset, with data augmentation to squeeze out a few more precent accuracy

Any `*_gpu_run*` versions contain outputs from running on a GPU machine.

These Jupyter notebooks are set up for presenting with RISE.
