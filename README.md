### Training simple neural networks on the MNIST dataset using keras

`MNIS_MLIS.ipynb` - train fully-connected and convolutional networks on full MNIST dataset
`MNIS_MLIS_small.ipynb` - same, on 10% of the MNIST dataset, with data augmentation to squeeze out a few more precent accuracy
`MNIS_MLIS_noisy.ipynb` - as above, but with noisy data

The `*_gpu_run*` versions contain outputs from running on a GPU machine.

All these Jupyter notebooks are set up for presenting with RISE.
