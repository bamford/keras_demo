### Training simple neural networks on the MNIST dataset using keras

For the National Meeting of Data-Intensive Science CDTs in Edinburgh.

Train some simple fully-connected and convolutional networks on the MNIST dataset, with data augmentation to squeeze out a few more percent accuracy.

`MNIST_Edinburgh.ipynb` - bare version

`MNIST_Edinburgh_presentation.ipynb` -  version with extra material and figures

These Jupyter notebooks are set up for presenting with RISE.
